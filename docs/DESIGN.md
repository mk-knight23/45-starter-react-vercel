## Visual Philosophy
The design follows a **Premium SaaS / Cloud-Native** aesthetic. It uses a clean white base with deep Indigo-600 accents, focusing on massive typography and spacious layouts to convey a sense of "speed of thought."

## Design Patterns
-   **Fluid Layouts**: Use of large (4rem+) border radii for sections and buttons to create a soft, friendly but professional feel.
-   **Glassmorphic Nav**: Fixed header with high-blur backdrops for a modern layered experience.
-   **Noise Gradients**: Subtle grain filters on primary CTA sections to provide spatial depth.
-   **Vibrant Indigo**: Primary color theme focusing on indigo-600 with slate-900 typography.

## Color Palette
-   **Canvas**: White (#ffffff)
-   **Primary Action**: Indigo-600 (#4f46e5)
-   **Technical Text**: Slate-900 (#0f172a)
-   **Subtle Details**: Slate-400/500 (#94a3b8)

## Interaction Design
-   **Hover States**: Active scaling (95%) on buttons for tactile feedback.
-   **Reveal Animations**: Section-based "whileInView" triggers from Framer Motion.
-   **Smooth Navigation**: Internal anchors with CSS smooth scrolling pre-configured.
